	Hello everyone! My name is Nicola Limbach and I am currently a Workday Integrations Consultant in Atlanta, GA. Originally from Pittsburgh, PA, I attended university at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA. Despite not knowing how to code, I became a Business Information Technology major (similar to MIS) which introduced me to introductory Java, VBA, and VB.NET. At the time, I wasn't too fond of programming.
	<br><br>
	When I started working I learned XSLT and continued to improve my VBA skills by helping non-technical teams with macros. The more I programmed, the better I understood it and the more fun I found it. I am now participating in a programming bootcamp at Georgia Tech to continue to broaden my technical skills.
